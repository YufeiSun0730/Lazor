# Lazor Game Solver
### Software Carpentry Lazor project Fall 2021

Group member: Yufei Sun, Mordred Yuan



Here we present a solver that can read and solve a lazor puzzle from the lazor mobile app. 

You can open the lazor_solver__.py file and input the link to the downloaded bff file in the corresponding filename place. Alternatively, you can use our uploaded game files in the folder /LazorProjectFall2021. We have stored our test codes in the /test_code folder, in which we tried methods such as recusion and dfs.

In the solver, we used permutation method to find the place to place blocks that will give the winning solutions. The solver as a whole includes Block, Grid, and Lazor class. They are the essential building blocks when we are trying to solve the lazor game!
